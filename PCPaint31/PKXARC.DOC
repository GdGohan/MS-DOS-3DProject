Overview
--------

An  archive  is  a  collection  of  one or more files placed into a 
single archive file.  A file extension of .ARC is usually  used  to 
denote  an  archive.  Each file in an archive is compressed to save 
disk space, backup storage space, and file transfer time.   When  a 
file  is  archived,  it  is  analyzed  and compressed with the most 
optimal data compression method for that file.  Every  file  in  an 
archive  is  stored  with a 16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to 
ensure data integrity when the file is extracted from the archive.

PKXARC  is  a  FAST! archive extraction utility that extracts files 
from an archive and restores them to their original name, size, time 
and  date.   It  is  completely  compatible  with  SEA's  (Software 
Enhancement Associate's) ARC program and  PKWARE's  FAST!   archive 
create/update  utility  PKARC,  but is many times faster than SEA's 
ARC program and faster than  ANY  OTHER  archive  extract  utility.  
PKXARC achieves its speed through the use of C language with highly 
optimized assembly language routines, and advanced  file  buffering 
techniques.

Usage: PKXARC [options] archive [d:\path] [file...]


Options are:

  -r = replace existing file(s)         -v = verbose listing of archive(s)
  -c = extract file(s) to the screen    -p = extract file(s) to the printer
  -t = test archive integrity           -l = display software license
  -e,-x = extract file(s) 
  -g<password> = extract garbled file with password

  archive  Archive file name, wildcards *,? ok.  Default extension 
	   is .ARC

  d:path\  Output drive and/or path.  Note that only one output
	   path can be specified, and it must be seperated from the 
	   list of files to extract by one or more spaces.  The
	   output path can be anywhere on the command line after
	   the options though.

  file     Name(s) of files to extract, list, or test.
	   Wildcards *,? okay.  Default is ALL files.


-r    Normally,  PKXARC  will  prompt  you  with  "Overwrite?"   if 
      extracting  a file from an archive will overwrite an existing 
      file.  The  Replace  option  will  overwrite  existing  files 
      without query.

-c    This option will extract files to the screen.

-p    This  option  will extract files to the printer.  PKXARC will 
      print a form feed after each file.

-t    This option  will  test  archive  integrity.   Particularily, 
      PKXARC  will  calculate  each  files CRC value and compare it 
      with the stored value within the archive.  A message will  be
      displayed to indicate the integrity of each file.
        
-v    This option is used to list the contents of an  archive.   It 
      will  list  the  filename, length of file before compression, 
      method of compression, size  after  compression,  compression 
      ratio, and the stored CRC value.
      
-l    This option will display PKWARE's software license and address.

-e    These options will extract files from an archive.  This is the
-x    default for PKXARC if no other options are specified.  The -e
      and -x options do not have to be specified for this.  They are
      only present for compatibility with SEA's ARC  program  syntax.
      The -e and -x options can not be used with other options.

-g<password>
      Extract encrypted (garbled) files with the given password.

Using PKXARC in a batch file
---------------------------

If you are using PKXARC from a batch file, you can test  if  PKXARC 
experienced  an  error  using  the DOS errorlevel variable.  PKXARC 
returns zero errorlevel if no errors have occurred.   If  an  error 
occurred, PKXARC will return the following error codes:

abort exit codes:
  2 - out of memory
  3 - no archives found to extract
  4 - can't open archive file
  5 - read error on archive
  6 - internal table overflow
  7 - disk full

non-abort (warning) exit codes:
  1 - bad CRC, file is not an archive, unknown compression method,
      can't create a file, squeeze table is invalid or no files
      found to extract.


Mulitasking and Network Support
-------------------------------

PKXARC  automatically  opens  all  archives  with SHARE "deny write 
access"  under  DOS  3.0  or  above,  so  that  they  can  be  read 
concurrently  by other tasks.  This is especially useful when using 
PKXARC on Local Area Networks (LANs) or with multi-tasking software.

PKXARC messages
---------------

Warning!  File XXXXXXXX.YYY already exists!  overwrite (y/n)?
  - A file to be extracted from the archive already exists on disk.  
    Answer  "y"  to  extract  the  file from the archive anyway and 
    overwrite the existing file, "n" to not extract the  file  from 
    the archive.  Use the "-r" command line option to suppress this 
    warning.

Unknown packing method for: XXXXXXXX.YYY
  - The file is compressed  or  encoded  in  a  unknown  way.   The 
    archive is either corrupt or requires a later version of PKXARC 
    for proper extraction.

Warning!  File XXXXXXXX.YYY fails CRC check
  - The Cyclic Redundancy  Check  calculation  did  not  match  the 
    stored value.  The file is probably corrupt.

XXXXXXXX.YYY is not an archive
  - The file specified is either not an archive, or is corrupt.

Archive length error
  - A end of file token  was  not  found  for  a  file  within  the 
    archive.  The archive is corrupt.

PKXARC: can't find XXXXXXXX.YYY
  - The given archive filename could not be found.

PKXARC: Can't read archive: XXXXXXXX.YYY
  - The archive could not be opened.

PKXARC: Can't create: XXXXXXXX.YYY
  - The  output file could not be created.  The output directory is 
    invalid or full.

PKXARC: File has invalid decode tree
  - The Huffman decode tree for the file is invalid.   The  archive 
    is corrupt.

PKXARC: Disk full
  - The destination disk is full.

PKXARC: Internal table overflow
  - An internal decode table overflowed.  The archive is corrupt.

PKXARC history
--------------

Soon  after  the archive file format was introduced into the public 
domain, it became popular and many BBS files were  transfered  this 
way.   The  archive format is a convenient way to put several files 
into one and compress them for effecient disk storage  and  reduced 
transfer time, in one step.

However, the archive utility was much slower  at  extracting  files 
than  equivalent  UnSQueeze type programs.  In the inevitable quest 
for faster archive file extraction, PKXARC was created.


Changes in PKXARC version 3.5
-----------------------------

Extraction of Crunched files are up to 25% faster  and  unSquashing 
is up to 50% faster than ever before.

New -e and -x options have been added for ARC compatibility.

The  DOS  switch  character  is  now  supported  as  a valid option 
seperator.

The '-' character can  be  used  in  addition  to  the  DOS  switch 
character for options.

The -g "arc garble" decryption option is supported.

Both '/' and '\' characters are allowed in pathnames.

Multitasking and Network support has been added to PKXARC.

Wildcard file matching using '?' in the extension now works exactly 
like DOS directory wildcard matching.

To  help  facilitate  the  automated  use of PKXARC, PKXARC will no 
longer abort to DOS when a bad archive  is  encountered,  but  will 
continue  on  to the next archive.  PKXARC's return codes have been 
extended to include errors  that  do  not  cause  PKXARC  to  abort 
immediately (warnings).

Damaged archive handling has been vastly improved.  PKXARC will  no 
longer  hang up on badly damaged, truncated, or encrypted archives.  
In addition, PKXARC will automatically skip bad archive headers and 
will  attempt  to  extract  as many files from a damaged archive as 
possible.

PKXARC   FAST!   Archive Extract Utility   Version 3.5  04-27-87    Page 8



Changes in PKXARC version 3.4
-----------------------------

Support of "squashed" files created by PKARC 2.0  has  been  added.  
Squashing is a variation of Dynamic Ziv-Lempel-Welch encoding which 
can yield a 10% or better compression ratio for large  text  files.  
Squashed  files  typically  unsquash  15%  faster  than  equivalent 
crunched files.

In order to be consistent with the command  syntax  of  PKARC,  the 
requirement   for  dashes  ("-")  to  be  given  before  individual 
filenames to extract or list has been removed.

Error  recovery  for  damaged archives has been improved.  Previous 
versions of PKXARC would  occasionally  hang  up  while  processing 
damaged  archives.   PKXARC version 3.4 has improved error recovery 
allowing at least the partial extraction of files  from  a  damaged 
archive.


Changes in PKXARC version 3.3
-----------------------------

Support of the PKARC archive comment  feature  was  added.   PKXARC 
will  automatically  display an archive comment if it is present in 
an archive.

When extracting files to the  printer,  PKXARC  will  now  print  a 
form-feed character after each file.

Extraction speed has been increased by 5% for Crunched files.


Changes in PKXARC version 3.2
-----------------------------

The  archive test function "/t" was added to PKXARC.  This function 
tests the integrity of the archive without extracting the files  to 
disk.  Specifically, the CRC for each file is computed and compared 
against the correct value stored in the archive.

Extraction speed has been increased by 5% for most files.

PKXARC   FAST!   Archive Extract Utility   Version 3.5  04-27-87    Page 9



Changes in PKXARC version 3.1
-----------------------------

A  minor  bug  in  the  pattern  matching  code for individual file 
specifications when using the wildcard "*" was fixed.  For example, 
previous versions of PKXARC would not correctly match "flight*.com" 
to the exact filename "flight.com".  This  has  been  corrected  in 
PKXARC version 3.1.

The  verbose archive listing now displays the total number of files 
in the archive.

Extraction speed has been increased  5-10%  for  all  decompression 
methods.

A  "jr"  version  of  PKXARC was created for computers with limited 
memory.  PKXARCjr requires only 74K of free memory to run,  but  is 
slightly  slower than the standard version for most archives.  Both 
versions will run on  any  type  of  computer  providing  there  is 
sufficient free memory.


Changes in PKXARC version 3.0
-----------------------------

The following functions have been added to PKXARC version 3.0:

Extraction of files to the console or printer.
The ability to display a verbose archive listing.


Changes in PKXARC version 2.7
-----------------------------

Extraction performance of Squeezed files  has  been  improved  more 
than 60%.  PKXARC version 2.7 can extract a Squeezed file more than 
8 times faster than ARC 5.1.

The message displayed when a  file  is  being  extracted  has  been 
enhanced to indicate the compression method used to store the file.

Message                 Meaning
-------                 -------
Extracting   The file was Stored.
un-Packing   The file was Packed with non-repeat packing.
uncrunching  The file was crunched with old style Ziv-Lempel-Welch compression.
unSqueezing  The file was Squeezed with Huffman encoding.
unCrunching  The file was Crunched with Dynamic Ziv-Lempel-Welch compression.
unSquashing  The file was Squashed with Dynamic Ziv-Lempel-Welch compression.

Changes in PKXARC version 2.6
-----------------------------

Extraction  performance  for  all  compression   types   has   been 
significantly  improved  over  PKXARC  version 2.5.  Files that are 
crunched with older versions of ARC (pre 5.x)  extract  5%  faster.  
Squeezed  files  extract  15% faster.  Files that are Crunched with 
ARC 5.x extract 20% faster.


Changes in PKXARC version 2.5
-----------------------------

The ability to extract specific files was added.  PKXARC can now be 
passed  the specific names of files to be extracted from an archive 
on the command line.


Changes in PKXARC version 2.4
-----------------------------

Performance  for  extracting  dynamic  Ziv-Lempel  files  has  been 
improved. Files which are identified as "Crunched" (with a  capital 
C) on the ARC verbose listing extract 15-20% faster than before.

When  a  "Disk  full"  error  occurred, previous versions of PKXARC 
would leave an empty or incomplete file on the  disk.   PKXARC  now 
deletes  any  incomplete  files  before aborting with a "Disk full" 
error.



Changes in PKXARC version 2.3
-----------------------------

The  ability  to extract dynamic Ziv-Lempel-Welch encoded files was 
added.  Version  5.0  of  ARC  introduced  a  new,  more  efficient 
variation  of Ziv-Lempel "Crunching".  PKXARC can now extract files 
Crunched with this method, approximately 3 times  faster  than  ARC 
5.1.
