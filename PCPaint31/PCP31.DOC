About the Font Files (INSTALL diskette)

The .FNT files provided with PC Paint 3.1 are standard.  They allow you to 
enter text in a variety of sizes and shapes into PC Paint graphic screens.
The .SET font files are provided by Data Transforms Inc, and by Microtex 
Industries.  PC Paint 3.1 comes with a discount coupon for additional 
fonts from Data Transforms.  You may also purchase their FONTRIX font editor 
that allows you to edit or create specialized fonts of your own.


About the Archiving Utilities (DRIVERS diskette)

The PKARC utilities are file archiving and dearchiving programs provided
as a shareware product by PKWARE, Inc.  The files have the following uses:

	PKARC.COM  - create/modify an archive (PKARC.DOC explains how)
	PKXARC.COM - extract file(s) from archive (see PKXARC.DOC)
	PKSFX.PGM  - header to create self-extracting archive (see PKSFX.DOC)

These programs are high-quality tools that you can use to compress numerous 
space-consuming files into one or more archive files.  The archives take much 
less room on your disk and remove the clutter from your directories.  They are
the ideal way to store seldom-used files such as old drawings.  You may also 
use them to display the contents of an archive, update and freshen the files 
inside, and extract one or more files from the archive.  Full documentation 
is included in corresponding .DOC files.


About Inset's Graphic Screen Printing (DRIVERS diskette)

Inset is a resident program provided by Inset Systems, Inc., that prints 
graphic screen images.  It works with any program, not just PC Paint.  It can 
integrate text and graphics, provided they are in Inset's special file format.
If you want this extended capability, then you must buy the commercial 
version of Inset, and Inset's HiJaak file conversion software.  Inset has
provided a coupon with PC Paint 3.1 that you can send in for a 25% discount
on the Inset/HiJaak product.


About the Sample Drawings (DRAWINGS diskette)

The drawing files provided with PC Paint 3.1 are pictures that you can edit 
with PC Paint 3.1 to create striking visual presentations on your computer, 
and to load into a desktop publishing program such as Ventura or Page Maker
for printing on a dot matrix or laser printer.  You may also print them
with the Inset program provided with PC Paint 3.1.

There are two categories of picture files; you can display all of them on
an enhanced VGA system by entering the command SHOWPIC *.PIC *.CLP:

	1.  PIC - these files are provided by MSC in PC Paint's own
multi-color, multi-resolution file format.  The first letter of each
file name is the letter of the video mode in which the file was created.
For a complete list of the video modes, run PC Paint and look at the first
screen.  For example, CGA pictures start with A or C; you can display and 
edit them on almost any color system.

	LGINA.PIC is a mode L picture (320 x 200, 256 colors) of Gina; 
you can only display the picture if you have a VGA or MCGA video system 
in your computer (standard on the IBM PS/2).  LGINA.PIC was created using 
the VIA image capture board from Jovian Logic connected to a normal color 
television camera.  The LKATHY.PIC file was created in the same way and is 
provided by Jovian Logic (Fremont, CA).  Both images had their palettes 
reorganized for optimum display using image enhancement tools from
Microtex Industries (San Juan Capistrano, CA).

	MFISH.PIC is a mode M VGA picture that shows how dramatically
beautiful PC Paint can make a simple clip art image using dithered spread
fills with only 16 colors!  Imagine what it can do with 256 colors...an
example is shown in LMSC.PIC.

	2.  PCX - these PicturePak files are provided free of charge by 
Marketing Graphics Inc.  They are all monochrome (black and white) pictures
in 640 x 480 (VGA high resolution) format, and are ideal clip art for
editing and printing.  PC Paint can load and save files in PCX format.
Please read the PicturePak information at the end of this file.  It contains
a printable order form for additional clip art from MGI.


HOW TO INSTALL PC PAINT 3.1

The INSTALL.EXE program on the INSTALL diskette allows you to install all 
required files onto either a floppy diskette or hard disk.  It can create a 
PAINT.BAT batch file that automatically runs both Inset and PC Paint for you
when you enter the command PAINT.  We recommend that you run INSTALL, 
whether you are an experienced user or a novice.


How to Load Files onto Your Disk withour Running Install

PC Paint 3.1, Inset, utilities, and sample drawings, are compressed inside
self-extracting archive files on the PC Paint floppy diskettes.  The
compression technique allows us to put more files on a diskette to simplify
diskette organization for easier installation.

You may extract all or part of the files from inside a self-extracting 
archive to a hard disk or floppy by entering the command 

	<archive> <-parm> <destination> <filelist>

where <archive> is the name of the archive file, <parm> is a parameter 
(? to list parameters, T to list archive contents), <destination> is a valid 
drive and directory pathname, and <filelist> is a list of file names to 
extract, separated by spaces.  

One large archive file is located on each of the diskettes you received with
PC Paint, as follows:


DISKETTE	ARCHIVE		CONTENTS

INSTALL		PCP31.EXE	The PC Paint program and its utilities
DRIVERS		PCP31U.EXE	The Inset printer utility
				Screen and printer drivers are not archived
DRAWINGS	PCP31D.EXE	Sample images created in various video modes


As an example of use, if you have a hard disk, perform the following steps
to extract all of the drawings and place them in the \IMAGES directory
on drive C:

	1.  Insert the DRAWINGS diskette in drive A:
	2.  Enter these commands:

		MD C:\IMAGES		make images directory
		A:PCP31D C:\IMAGES	extract all drawings from archive.

Other examples of usage of the self extracting archive commands are:

A:PCP31 -?		list the possible command line parameters
A:PCP31 -T		list files in the archive
A:PCP31 C:\PCP		extract paint files to drive C: directory PCP
A:PCP31U C:\PCP		extract printer utility files to C:\PCP
A:PCP31 -C PCP31.DOC	display the text in PCP31.DOC file from the archive
A:PCP31 B: *.SET	extract font files to floppy in drive B:


HOW TO USE INSET AND PC PAINT 3.1

You must have a mouse or a digitizer that emulates a mouse installed on 
your computer before running PC Paint.  To run PC Paint, enter the command 
PCPAINT.  The initial screen shows a video mode list.  Select a mode you 
think you will like and a few seconds later the PC Paint menu screen will 
appear.  You can now the mouse to create a drawing.  If the menu screen
does not appear, then the mode you selected is not valid.  Press Alt-Q to
quit PC Paint, then run it again and select a different mode.

You must run Inset if you want to print graphic images created with PC Paint.  
You do not have to run Inset unless you want to print graphic images, but
if you do, then you must run Inset BEFORE the showing the image on the screen.
  
Before running Inset, you must set it up for the video adapter in your 
computer (the part of the system that displays an image) and the printer your 
computer will use to print the image.  INSTALL does this for you, but you may
do it any time by entering the command SETUP.  Press keys to select the 
options in the configuration menu and follow instructions.  Be sure to select 
a video board, video mode, and printer type.  Then save the configuration 
(F10), and quit the program (Esc).

Setup creates a configuration file (IN.SET) for Inset to use, so that you do 
not have to run it again unless you change your system configuration or 
want to print graphic screens from a different video mode.

Once Inset has been setup, you can use it immediately with any program that 
can display a graphic image.  To load it into memory, enter the command INSET.
The display will show the hotkey combination (Ctrl Left-Shift) to press in 
order to invoke Inset's printing capability.

To prove that Inset is working properly, run the TEST.BAT program to print 
a test image and document on your printer.  If it doesn't work, recheck 
your configuration and refer to the manual as needed.

Now run the program that displays the graphics screen you want to print.
For example, run PC Paint.  To do this, enter the command PCPAINT.  
PC Paint needs no installation because video mode selection is built-in.  The 
first screen will show your choices of video modes.  Select the same mode
that you selected in the Setup program.  The paint screen appears.  Now you 
can create an image using the mouse.  Refer to the manual for details on
how to use the paint program.

Once the screen is showing the image properly, invoke Inset by pressing 
the hotkey.  Press P (print) then G (go) to print the image.  You can
modify it first by pressing M, then C to crop the image, and so on.
Inset's Save feature is disabled.  If you want the feature, then purchase
the commercial version of Inset.

Some images can take all of the memory available, leaving none for the 
printing program.  If you get an out-of-memory message while using PC Paint, 
then quit the paint program, and enter the command AF to delete Inset from
memory.  Now run paint again, finish creating your picture, save it in
a picture file (for example MYPAINT.PIC), and quit PC Paint.  When you are 
ready to print the picture, display it by entering the command 
SHOWPIC MYPAINT, then press the hotkey to invoke Inset.  Full details are
in the manual.


HOW TO RUN PC PAINT 3.1

To execute PC PAINT, change to the directory holding the paint program files
and enter the following command, where <options> is a list of optional
command line parameters and <filename> is a picture file to edit:

	PCPAINT <options> <filename>

With no <options>, PC Paint will run and display a list of the paint program 
video modes available on your computer.  When you select one of the valid
modes, the paint screen will come alive.  Optional parameters are as follows:

	/2	Use Hercules page 2
	/q	Do double mouse I/O for old Microsoft mouse
	/w	Force mouse cursor to ignore vertical retrace
	/z	Select dragging-style pull-down menus
	/m:V,S	Select mouse velocity V and sensitivity S (0-7)
	/v:M	Select video mode M (other valid modes are shown below)

MODE	VIDEO ADAPTER

1	IBM text 80 x 25 x 16

P	Tseng Labs VGA 800 x 600 x 2 (mode 29h)
Q	Tseng Labs VGA 800 x 600 x 16 (mode 29h)


Extended High-Resolution Modes

The initial screen shows extended high resolution modes P and Q at the bottom 
of the mode list.  These are non-IBM 800 x 600 resolutions available on 
enhanced VGA boards based on Tseng Labs and Video 7 designs.  The modes may
also work on other video boards such as those based on VGA chipsets from 
Paradise and Cirrus Logic.  To find out whether they work on yours, 
select the mode and wait a few seconds for the paint screen to appear.  If
no screen appears, press Alt-Q to quit PC Paint, then try the command line
method that follows.

You may also invoke the extended high-resolution modes from the command line.
Some modes may be available other than 800 x 600.  Consult your video board
technical information to get a mode list.  MSC makes no guarantee that 
PC Paint will work in these modes on your system.  Invoke a high-resolution 
mode with the following command:

	PCPAINT /V:M,<horizontal>,<vertical>,<AX register>,<BX register>

Example command lines would be:

for Video 7 VEGA VGA - 		PCPAINT /V:M,800,600,0x6f05,0x62
for Everex (Cirrus) VGA -	PCPAINT /V:M,720,540,0x63

Video mode M causes PC Paint to assume the same memory organization as VGA 
BIOS video mode 12.  <horizontal> is the number of pixels across the screen 
(e.g., 800), <vertical> is the number of pixels down the screen (e.g., 600), 
<AX register> and <BX register> represent the contents of your computer's 
microprocessor AX and BX registers required by BIOS to perform the Set Video 
Mode function that puts the video board in the extended high resolution mode.
The register values are entered in C programming language notation.  For 
example in the value 0x6f05, the leading 0x means the following digits are 
a hexadecimal number.

Refer to the technical data in your video board's manual for information
on the register contents required to invoke extended graphics modes.

HOW TO USE THE PC PAINT 3.1 UTILITY PROGRAMS

WHATPIC <filelist> - display the size and video mode of named picture files 
separated by spaces.  e.g. WHATPIC *.PIC.  Invoke PC Paint with the mode
shown in order to edit the picture file using PC Paint 3.1.

SHOWPIC <filelist> - display the named picture files.  If you have a multiple 
scanning frequency monitor and one of the modern enhanced VGA cards, you can 
display a mix of CGA, EGA, MCGA, and VGA images.  Press Enter to go to the 
next picture, PgUp/PgDn to move the image up and down; click left button to 
toggle crosshairs on and off, right to toggle display of X/Y coordinates.

CVTPICS <video mode> <filelist> - convert a PC PAINT PLUS picture file to
PC Paint 3.1 format.  Also converts PIC and CLP files from one video format
to another.  Only default palettes translate properly.

CAP <parameter> - resident program to capture a screen image and save it in a 
PC Paint 3.1 file (.PIC).  Press Alt-RightShift to invoke, and Esc to quit.
While in CAP, one of two methods saves the image. 1) To save the whole screen, 
press Enter, type the filename, press Enter; 2) To save an area of the screen,
move the cursor to start-of-clip and press spacebar (press a number key to 
change cursor step rate, period (.) to change the active corner, semicolon (;) 
to seek inward for an edge), move the cursor to end-of-clip and press Enter, 
type the filename, press Enter.  If the filename contains a number, you may
save screens in sequentially numbered files automatically.  Parameters are:

	/k:<key><key> - change the keys used to invoke CAP, where <key> is 
		L (left shift), R (right shift), C (Ctrl), or A (Alt).
	/i:# - set the user software interrupt number that invokes CAP to #;
		e.g. CAP /i5 sets CAP to be invoked with Shift-PrtSc.

To download picture files to your computer, call (714) 240-7459.  To discuss
PC Paint, pictures, and demonstrations, enter GO PICS on Compuserve.


HOW TO CONVERT PICTURE FILES BETWEEN FORMATS

You may use a variety of methods to convert files between various graphics 
formats:

	1.  Use PC Paint 3.1 to load a file in one of the following formats:

		PIC (PC Paint 3.1)
		PIC-BSAVE (PC Paint Plus or PC Paint 3.1)
		PCX (Z-Soft's PC Paintbrush)
		GIF (Compuserve compressed)

and then save the image in any of those formats or in 

		IMG (Digital Research Inc.'s GEM) format.

	2.  Use the CVTPICS program supplied with PC Paint 3.1 to convert 
a PIC file created in one video mode to a PIC file that you can edit in 
another video mode.  You must use Cvtpics to convert an EGA mode file 
created with PC Paint Plus to EGA mode for use with PC Paint 3.1; otherwise, 
PC Paint 3.1 will not be able to display the image properly.  You may also 
use it to convert files from low to high resolution (such as CGA to EGA or 
EGA to VGA), but it will not expand the picture to fill the screen.
Finally, you may convert from high to low resolution form, but if the source
file has more colors than the destination file, the colors in the resulting
image will not be correct. 

	3.  Use a file conversion utility program to convert between one of 
the above formats and a format native to some other paint program.  Discount 
coupons are supplied with PC Paint 3.1 for two different conversion programs, 
each with its own distinct advantages:

		a.  TGLPLUS (The Graphics Link Plus) from Terravision - this
extremely powerful program not only converts between file formats used by 
major paint programs, but it also offers outlining and conversion from
color to dithered black and white images suitable for use in high-quality
desk-top publishing applications.

		b.  HiJaak from Inset Systems - this program comes with the 
commercial version of Inset.  It converts between the file formats of numerous
paint programs as TGLPLUS does, and it can create PIX files that Inset uses
for integration with text to create professional quality graphics/text page
layouts and manuals using a normal text processor.  It can also capture 300
dpi images being sent to an HP Laserjet from any application program so that
you can edit them with PC Paint 3.1.  If you have Hijaak, you can use Inset
to print full-size images that are larger than the screen can show.


HOW TO ANIMATE YOUR PICTURES PROFESSIONALLY

You can use the SHOWPIC program supplied with PC Paint 3.1 to display a series
of images from PIC files that you created with PC Paint 3.1.  Showpic thus
gives you a way to give a simple graphics presentation to an audience with
your computer because it displays the next picture each time you press the
Enter key.

However, if you want to animate your images for a truly professional-quality
presentation, a discount coupon is provided with PC Paint 3.1 to allow you to 
purchase GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for Professionals) from Paul Mace
Software, Inc.  GRASP gives you a complete environment for creating animated
graphics presentations, including its own programming language, an editor,
sample programs, built-in help, and a run-time animator.  GRASP has built
a reputation for state-of-the-art graphics animation, and has been used to
create demonstrations in television commercials as well as computer trade
shows.
