        This is a file of sample text to be output to your printer.
        What this test will demonstrate is INSET's ability to integrate
        screen images into your printer output.  The text can be
        printed from almost any report software.  The images can be
        captured from almost any program on your PC.  Also, images can
        be created or modified at any time with INSET's graphics editor
        (even in your word processor!).

        If INSET has been properly    [test]
        installed, you should see an
        image of a woman's face in
        this document.  Note that
        words and images can be
        located side by side.  Also
        notice that the text is
        printed in your printers text
        mode and the image is printed
        in graphics mode.  Your
        printer output is slowed only
        by the amount of graphics to
        be printed.

        If this printout appears correct, read the "USING INSET"
        section of your manual to learn more.  If you have problems
        read "APPENDIX A:  TROUBLE SHOOTING" to solve your problems.

        Congratulations!  Your are now a part of the INSET.  If your
        report isn't read, how effective are your efforts?  INSET
        images make the difference!
