KNOWN BUGS THAT ARE BEING FIXED

1.  PC Paint 3.1

	a.  Command line 800x600 mode does not show a proper menu screen:  
	color boar is chopped off, and Esc twice causes small viewport with 
	color bar to show inside normal viewport.  The solution is to use
	full screen mode for painting the image.

	b.  Sometimes saves PCX files in a format that distorts the image when
	displayed by other programs such as Word Perfect.  Displays some PCX 
	files created by other programs in a distorted, unrecognizable form.

2.  Inset changes EGA screen colors upon return from the help menu on images
	that do not use the default palette.  The temporary solution is 
	to put the image on the screen anew, then do not use Inset's help
	menu while that screen is displayed.
