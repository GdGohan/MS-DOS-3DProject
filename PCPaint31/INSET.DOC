                   Getting Started without the Manual
                        (.. and Change Notes)

        Once you have copied the INSET SYSTEM disk on to your Work
        disk, run the INSET.EXE program to configure INSET for your
        system.

        Then, run the TEST.BAT program to verify that INSET is
        installed properly for your system.

        Remember, if all else fails read the manual.  It's informative
        and it has lots of pictures!

        Support Notes:
                A list of technical support rules is provided on the
                Driver disk in the INSET.RUL file.  To display rules
                pertaining to your problem run the INTECH program on
                the driver diskette.

        Change NOTES for INSET 2.2 A for users familiar with INSET 2.1 C
              o Fast print optimization through .FST files added
                for 4x to 10x speed improvement!
              o To load a small, capture only, version of InSet load
                InSet with the /C option (uses the I20C.EXE file).
              o Contrast control added to Modify/Ink to optimize
                grey scale dithering for text and graphics.
              o 16 Colors supported on output to color printers.
              o Pallette control added to allow the user to change
                display colors.
              o Maximum .PIX size option added to SETUP.COM.  This option
                can reduce RAM usage for user's of Screen only graphics
                or allow them to process huge .PIX files.
              o VGA, MCGA, WYSE, and Genius Drivers added
              o PIX Files opened read only when viewing and printing
                (enhanced CD ROM compatability)
              o Natural size expansion when viewing larger than screen
                images works correctly
        ----------------------------------------------
        Change NOTES for INSET 2.1 C users familiar with INSET 2.1 B
              o The Control-Break key will now work for halting ALL InSet
                time consuming tasks (ie. Printing, Preview, Conversion ...).
              o A PostScript driver has been added (see PS.NTS on driver disk
                for usage notes with different word processors)
              o The small version of InSet has been beefed up to handle very
                large images (brought in by HiJaak).
              o The default Pop-Up sequence has been changed to <Left-Shift>
                <Control>
        ----------------------------------------------
        Change NOTES for INSET 2.1 B users familiar with INSET 2.1 A
              o INSET has been modified to work better with Windows, terminal
                emulators, and other environments requiring Active keyboard
                mode in setup.
              o If the default pop up key is changed from Shift-Prtsc, INSET
                will no longer pop up on Shift-PrtSc
              o The EGA driver has been modified to support Chartmaster EGA
                Boeing Graph, and other graphics programs.
              o Support for older printers has been readded (ie. PRISM, OKI2410,
                IBMCOLOR, Hermes)
              o Modifications were made so that BIOSFIX.COM should no longer
                be needed with certain clone hardware
              o INSET will detect images that are too large for it to handle
        ----------------------------------------------
        Change NOTES for INSET 2.1 users familiar with INSET 2.0X:
              o Printing of Text screens is 4 times faster when inks are
                set to B&W.
              o INSET will handle larger than screen images up to 1MB of
                uncompressed data brought in by HiJaak.
              o You may Modify, Clip, and Print Larger Than Screen (LTS) images
                without loss of resolution (Sorry no LTS editing yet)
              o When a PRINT/GO is performed with a PIX tag on the screen,
                the image in the tag will be printed.
              o When merging graphics and text, merging may be aborted by
                popping up INSET.  You will have the option of either stopping
                or continuing the merge.
              o The override mode works two different ways:
                - If mode is set to CURRENT in setup, the override pop-up acts
                  like the default pop-up using the override macro
                - If mode is set to other than CURRENT, after initial override
                  pop-up, subsequent override pop-ups will rotate through all
                  of the supported screen modes until the proper screen mode
                  is found.
        ----------------------------------------------
        Change NOTES for users familiar with INSET 1.X:
              o Major upgrades include EDIT, PREVIEW, variable print RESIZE ...
                Now the image size won't change with different printers
              o If the PIX tag is on the screen, you can change all
                MODIFY options (except CLIP) without VIEWing
              o INSET 2.0 PIX files are in a new, screen independent format
                You must use the OLDPIX.EXE program to convert old PIX files
              o An AUTOFREE.COM program is now used to free inset from memory
              o You must use the SETUP.COM program to change INSET
                after initial installation
