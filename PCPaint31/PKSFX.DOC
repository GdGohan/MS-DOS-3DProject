PKSFX Self-Extract Utility
--------------------------

PKSFX is a program which allows you to create your own 
self-extracting EXE files.  Unlike other self-extracting programs, 
PKSFX does not require that the filename of the EXE file be 
manually entered by the user when run, or for the filename to be 
hardcoded into the executable file.  This flexibility allows PKSFX 
self-extracting files to be used in automated batch procedures and 
to be renamed at any time.

To create a self-extracting EXE file, follow these steps:

1) Use PKARC to create the archive with the desired files in it.
2) Copy the archive file to the end of the file PKSFX.PGM as follows:

    copy/b pksfx.pgm + archive.arc  file.exe
    
  where archive.arc is the full archive name created in step 1.
  file.exe is the name of the file you want to be self extracting, and
  must have an extension of .EXE.

PKSFX supports all of the options that PKXARC does, except for the 
'v' verbose list option.  Consult the file PKXARC.DOC for more 
information about PKXARC.  In addition, PKSFX should only used with 
archives created by SEA's ARC version 5.0 or later or any version 
of PKARC.  Archives created by versions of ARC before 5.0 will not 
extract properly.
